1. Open Netbeans
2. Under **Team** click on **Git** and select **Clone**
3. Enter the URL for this GitHub repository
4. Enter your GitHub user and password (I would suggest clicking Save password check box)
5. Click **Next**
6. Select only the __*master__ branch
7. When the project loads, you will most likely have a problem with the _Hamcrest binaries_, just click the **Resolve Problem** button.
You should be read to go.
